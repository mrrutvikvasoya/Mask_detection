# Mask_detection
This project sheds light on object detection and instance segmentation using the YOLO (you only live once) family of models, focusing primarily on fine-tuning a custom dataset for mask detection. My main goal is to turn mask-wearing statuses into three types: masks, no masks, and incomplete masks (masks that are being worn in the wrong manner).
